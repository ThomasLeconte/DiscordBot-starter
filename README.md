# Discord starter package
Little package for start a discord bot fastly and easily.  
**Disclaimer:** This is not the best way, just my favorite way to build a discord bot. You can propose your own ideas with a pull request ðŸ˜‰

## How use it

**First of all, run `npm install discord-starter-package` to add discordjs and this package on your project**.  

Then, you can init your bot instance with `init()` method :
```js
//main.js
const { init } = require("discord-starter-package");

const bot = init({
  options: null,
  token: "yourToken"
})
```
This method take many options :


```json
{
  "name": "Discord bot", //optional
  "token": "YourBotPrivateToken",
  "prefix": "/",  
  "autoLog": false,
  "adminRole": "admin", //optional
  "options": {}, //ClientOptions instance
  "webhooks": [], //optional
  "defaultCommandsDisabled": [] //optional
}
```
Have a look to all properties of an environment :  
- `name`: Your bot name
- `token`: Your bot private token
- `prefix`: Your bot prefix which be used at start of all your commands (when slash command option is not enabled on command)
- `autoLog`: Define if you want automatic logs when commands are executed for see command name, player and arguments provided.
- `adminRole`: Admin role name who's needed to admin commands. User will need to have a role with this name to allow execution.
- `options`: Options that you want to add on your bot. This property is just a copy of `Discord.CLientOptions` class.
- `webhooks`: List of webhooks that you want to use in your code.
- `defaultCommandsDisabled`: List of default commands provided by this package that you want to disable. You can disable one of these commands: `help`, `disableCommand`, `feedback`, `ping`

Finally, you can launch your discord bot with following command : `npm run bot`.

## Commands
Your commands must follow a specific pattern. The file will have to be a module exported, with differents arguments. Basically, a new command without slash command and aliases should be like that :
```ts
module.exports = {
  name: '',
  description: '',
  usage: '',
  slashCommand: {
    enabled: false,
    options: []
  },
  admin: false,
  alias: [],

  async execute(client, message, args){
  }
}
```

## Message
DiscordJS v13 has introduced new features like Buttons or Select Menu components. So you can add them easily in your messages, with my tool `MessageFormatter` ! It easy to use, trust me :-)
Just make a new instance of it and look at possibilites :
```ts
// Concider you're on a command file ...

const result = new MessageFormatter();
// add an Embed Message ... Pff, to easy :)
result.addEmbedMessage(SuccessEmbed(client, `**Disable - Success**`, `The command "${args[0]}" has been enabled !`));

// add a button ? Dude, I said it was easy to use, trust me !
result.addButton("Get karmated", "ðŸ’¥", "DANGER", "karma_button");

// add a selectMenu ? Look at that
result.addSelectMenu("When you will download my project ?", [
  { label: "NOW IT'S FANTASTIC !", description: "You're too strong dude", value: "now" },
  { label: "NEVER YOU SUCK !", description: "Dude, go back learn HTML", value: "never" }
], "download_menu");

// add attachment file
result.addFile("myPicture.png")

// All at same time ? Why not
result.addEmbedMessage(...)
  .addButton(...)
  .addSelectMenu(...)
  .setContent(...)
  ...

return result;
```

## Embeds pagination
Sometimes, a pagination should be great to not spam your channel. With Discord.JS v13 and Embeds components, user experience is so much better, and developers can make embeds pagination more cleaner ! So I made a tool for it : EmbedPaginator. It generate an embed with options provided in constructor, handle automatically buttons events and it shows the range of items corresponding to the current page.
You can personnalize your embed with available options of `EmbedMessage`, and personnalize skin of your previous / next button.
```ts
// Concider you're on a command file ...
const content = []
for (let i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
  content.push({ name: "name-" + i, value: "value-" + i })
}

// EmbedPaginator(client, message, content to show in embed, embed options, paginator options)
new EmbedPaginator(client, message, content, { title: "Items" }, { itemsPerPage: 10, nextLabel: "Next page", previousLabel: "Previous page" })
```
Pagination options are optionals. By default, there is 10 items per page, and pagination buttons looking like that :

## Message component event handling
Imagine that you just added a new button with `my_custom_id` customId property :
```ts
// Concider you're on a command file ...
const result = new MessageFormatter();
result.addButton("Get karmated", "ðŸ’¥", "DANGER", "karma_button");

return result;
```
With the `client` property in your command function `async execute(client: Bot, message: Message, args: any[])`, you can register an event when this new button will be clicked. For example, you want to log the player who clicked on the button. With the `interaction` that you must provide on event declaration, you will be able to get his / her username ! By using `client.setNewEvent()`, you can register an event for a button click or a select menu interaction (for the moment).
Check this out :

```ts
// Concider you're on a command file ...
const result = new MessageFormatter();
result.addButton("Get karmated", "ðŸ’¥", "DANGER", "karma_button");

client.setNewEvent(EventType.BUTTON_EVENT, "karma_button", (interaction) => {
  console.log(interaction.member.user.username + " has clicked on the main menu button");
});

return result;
```

## Modal Builder
Discord v13 just released first version of Modals. You can create fast instance of them with `ModalBuilder` : 
> Warning : Modals can be showed only after an interaction of any type (button click, slash command, etc ..)
```ts
// Concider you're on a command file ...
const modal = new ModalBuilder("My modal title", "my_modal_custom_id");
//Add text input or textarea
modal.addTextInput("My Input label", "my_input_custom_id", false) //textInput
modal.addTextInput("My Textarea label", "my_textarea_custom_id", true) //textarea
```

Like Embed components, you can handle interaction of modal submission like this :
```ts
client.setNewEvent(EventType.MODAL_SUBMIT_EVENT, modal.getCustomId(), (interaction) => {
  if(interaction.isModalSubmit()){
    console.log(`${interaction.customId} modal has been submitted...`);
  }
});
```

For more informations about modal, [check this out](https://discordjs.guide/interactions/modals.html#building-and-responding-with-modals).

## Context menu interaction
DiscordJS makes able creation of context menu items. I've developed more easily way to create it. You just have to use current client bot instance and call `addContextMenuItem()` function :
```ts
//Add context menu item
client.addContextMenuItem("test", message.guildId);
```
And obviously, you can declare an event when this menu item is used :
```ts
//Add event triggerer when context menu item is used
client.setNewEvent(EventType.CONTEXT_MENU_EVENT, "test", (interaction: Interaction) => {
  console.log(`${interaction.commandName} has been used...`);
});
```

## Webhooks
You can define all webhooks that you want to use with your bot. For do this, you just have to declare them inside `webhooks` property in environment that you're using.
```json
{
  ...
  "webhooks": [
    { "name": "myWebHook", "url": "https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/id/token" }
  ]
}
```
Then you can call your webhook with your bot client by the function `getWebhook(webhookName)`, inside one of your commands for example :
```ts
  async execute(client, message, args) {
    client.getWebHook("myWebHook").send("Hi")
    ...
  }
```
Errors are catched if webhook is not registered and reply with an error embed message to user, and also log error in your console.

## Log
By default, all environments have `autoLog` property on `false` value. But if you enable this property by changing it value to `true`, when a command (slash or not) will be executed, it will automatically log execution date, username, command name and command arguments.
You can log by yourself if you want, just use `client.log('YourContent')` ðŸ˜‰ UWhen you log something, log is prefixed by default with current date. But you can personalize prefix by using `client.log('YourContent', 'YourPrefix')`
